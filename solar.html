                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Not every country has access to all commodities such as abundant food, clean water, better health care services and education. According to a survey done by the World Bank and other institutions it has clearly come out that access to clean and sufficient energy is a main cause for segregation of countries according to classes and this greatly influences the countries overall wealth. Due to the increased demand for electrical energy many countries have introduced distributed generation systems (DGS). This system produces electricity locally rather than importing it from external sources and it mainly uses renewable sources of energy like solar, wind and thermal. Solar panels are emerging as one of the best options for generating electricity in industrial, commercial, and residential buildings.

                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>With the increased use of solar energy as a distribution generation system, there is a lack of sufficient knowledge and data that will provide the locals with enough description on the concept of solar trackers. This project, therefore, seeks to design a solar tracking system that will help in maximizing the power from solar and providing sufficient data that will help the locals switch from the use of fixed solar panels.

                <h2>Justification</h2>
                <p>Solar tracking system helps to increase the overall efficiency of solar energy production by tracking the movement of the sun and hence maximizing the collection of solar irradiances. Since solar is a renewable source of energy it will reduce the dependence on non-renewable sources helping the country to meet the increased electricity demand.
                    It also helps to reduce the stress on the distribution and transmission systems as it will act as a distributed generation system reducing the load connected which will help relieve congestion.
